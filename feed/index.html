				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that I&#8217;m 18 I can finally take people out for passenger laps and give people instruction on a race track. I&#8217;m working hard to raise the budget to race so haven&#8217;t spent any money on driving lessons yet. So even though I don&#8217;t have a driving license, I was still instructing people with driving licenses on the race track because I have have a racing license!

Teen racing driver <strong>Damani Marcano</strong> is back in the driving seat after a 12-month hiatus from the sport.  The young driver took time out from racing to complete his final year in full-time education and is now looking ahead to the 2018 season.  Damani has already been back out on the track, testing both a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DKMRacing/videos/1830597536957572/?hc_ref=ARSnYPh7X3aIoFOJ2xxgOizECWgpXilvOSTjjchNWM9vXQuw4Yd_9cZtY4XqPC_0Azs">Renault Clio Cup Car</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I-scux3Pm8">Volkswagen Racing Cup Golf Car</a>, and is assessing his racing options for next year.

<strong><a href="http://damanimarcano-racing.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/clio-rear.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-14871" src="http://damanimarcano-racing.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/clio-rear.jpg" alt="clio-rear" width="400" /></a>Racing Driver Damani Marcano comments: </strong><em>“It has been amazing to get back behind the wheel over the past few weeks and I can’t wait for the 2018 racing season. Keeping up with the media work to maintain my sponsorship was a full-time job and was impacting my studies. It was a difficult decision to take time out of racing to finish my last year in school, but it was the right one. Now I feel that I’m coming back stronger and more determined than ever. I need to be because I’m back to square one, raising sponsorship to fund next season. It’s going to be a huge challenge but so far the interest I’ve had from brands and partners has been incredibly positive. I’m really excited to make next season happen and build a solid professional career as a racing driver!”</em>

At just 16, Damani was breaking records with his racing, he was the youngest driver to complete a full season in the Volkswagen Racing Cup, the youngest driver to race in the VAG Trophy, qualify on the front row and gain fastest lap in a VAG Trophy race – competing against much older drivers.

The costs to participate in Motorsports are some of the highest in the sporting sector, with most young drivers entering the sport being fully supported by wealthy families. Damani wasn’t in that position and he and his Dad had to raise the necessary funding via sponsorship and partnership deals.  The incredible social media engagement and media attention that Damani generated to attract the sponsorship he needed, was a full-time job in itself. Trying to maintain this and full-time education simply wasn't feasible and the young racer took a step back from racing to finish school. Now he's back, focusing on racing full-time and is creating waves on social media again.

Principal Tony Gilham comments:</strong> <em>“His ability to engage with the public, the social media, the amount of traffic that he’s generated in such a short period of time is phenomenal.  Within the last few weeks or so he’s begun to engage once again and immediately the traffic is there.  It would be great to get him back out in the car.”</em>

Damani is currently working to attract visionary partners and sponsors to join him on his journey back into racing in the 2018 season.  Brands have the opportunity to access his wide audience and to use his truly inspirational story to engage with their customers, as he battles the financial obstacles that the motorsport industry places on drivers.

<strong>Terence Dove, Karting Coach comments:</strong> <em>“Damani is a pioneer and an inspiration to any kids told to lower their expectations from life.  Motorsport desperately needs him to succeed.”</em>

Damani was spotted by Team-HARD. Racing in 2014 and became the youngest driver they had ever signed. Despite being too young to hold a driving license and never having raced a car before he went on to set records in 2015. Aged 16, he became the youngest driver to finish in the points in the first round of a Milltek Sport Volkswagen Racing Cup season. He ended the year in the top-7 on pace out of 30 drivers, challenging experienced adult drivers who had spent the season leading the championship. As a guest driver in the VAG Trophy, Damani also became the youngest driver to qualify on the front row and obtain fastest lap in a race. After a one year hiatus, to finish full-time education, Damani is back and focused on creating a professional racing career, against all odds.

<p style="text-align: right;">12<sup>th</sup> July 2016</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Damani Marcano: 2016 Season Update </strong></p>
Damani Marcano and his management team have made the very difficult decision to withdraw him from the remaining races of his 2016 season. Due to the challenges of continuous fund raising and growing academic demands, Damani and his team feel that to pause now will allow everyone the time to regroup and ultimately come back stronger.

At 17, Damani has undertaken ambitious academic challenges with A-Levels in Maths, Further Maths, Design Technology and Physics and the demands of this have impacted the time and energy he knows is required, in his training and race preparation, to excel on the track.

It was with this in mind that Damani and his team have decided to re-group and come back stronger, fitter and more determined than ever in the future.

Damani and his team would like to thank all <a title="Sponsors &amp; Partners" href="/partners/">sponsors and partners</a>, especially <strong>The Clever Baggers</strong> and <strong>Team-HARD.</strong> for their incredible support in this decision and look forward to pursuing this dream again in the future.

Damani was spotted by Team-HARD. Racing in 2014 and became the youngest driver they had ever signed. Despite being too young to hold a driving license and never having raced a car before he went on to set records in 2015. Aged 16, he became the youngest driver to finish in the points in the first round of a Milltek Sport Volkswagen Racing Cup season. He ended the year in the top-7 on pace, challenging experienced adult drivers who had spent the season leading the championship. As a guest driver in the VAG Trophy, Damani also became the youngest driver to qualify on the front row and obtain fastest lap in a race.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>STRIVES TO RAISE CASH AFTER SILVERSTONE CRASH</strong></p>
<strong>North London A-Level student</strong> and <strong>Hertfordshire racing driver</strong> Damani Marcano, recently competed in severe weather conditions in the VW Racing Cup at Silverstone (12th June 2016) – home of the British Grand Prix.  The 17 year old's first race of the day, in torrential rain and a blinding wall of spray, resulted in a serious crash with a car ahead that was crawling along the track having lost power. Invisible to Damani until the last second, the slow moving car suddenly appeared from the spray. Both drivers were fine and walked away from the collision, a testament to the levels of safety in motorsport today, but Marcano’s 260bhp Team-HARD. VW Golf GTI R Cup Car was left in bad shape.

After Race 1 the Team-HARD. crew pulled together in tremendous form, re-building Damani’s car, sourcing parts from team cars and even stripping Team Principal Tony Gilham’s road car for bodywork!  In the space of four hours the team brought Marcano’s car back to life and made them both race-ready, minutes before the call to line-up, the decision was made by race officials to cancel the second race and not risk the treacherous conditions again.

<em><strong>Continues below...</strong></em>

The crash at Silverstone was costly to the young driver and now the race is on to raise enough funding to perform permanent repairs to the car and support the continuation of his season at one of the biggest races of the year – Spa Francorchamps.  Damani is offering new sponsorship opportunities to local businesses in a bid to raise the funding he needs.

<img class="  wp-image-14281 alignright" src="http://damanimarcano-racing.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/silverstone-wet-track-damani-marcano.jpg" alt="silverstone-wet-track-damani-marcano" width="330" />The Volkswagen Racing Cup attracts grids of up to 30 drivers and is a support race in the British GT Championships, attracting spectators of up to 15,000 along with much larger viewing figures on Channel 4 and Motors TV. Damani, the youngest driver in the series, is tipped to be a future star of the British Touring Car Championships. Racing against experienced adult drivers only since he was 16 and now in only his second season Damani has been moving up the field with his best finish to date at the last round just 3 places from the podium.

With nearly <strong>4,000 followers</strong> on social media and over <strong>1.4million impressions on Twitter in 2016</strong> alone, VIP Hospitality packages and more, Damani Marcano presents a unique opportunity for local businesses to reach a wide new audience. Companies can support Damani with car-parts or cash sponsorship packages; all budgets can be accommodated.

After what happened to me it was obvious that visibility made racing too dangerous and the officials' decision to cancel the second race was the right call. Team HARD did an amazing job getting the car race-worthy in time, I can’t thank them enough. The repairs will make a big dent in my race budget and I don't know if it will cover that and Spa without affecting my ability to finish the season. With the support of local businesses that see the opportunity in being a part of my story, anything is possible. They will be joining the other brands from around the UK who have made my racing possible so far.”</em>

Along with his racing career, the Hertfordshire based 17 year old is studying ALevels in Further Maths, Maths, Physics and Design Technology in the 6th form of a school in Haringey, North London.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>STRIVES TO RAISE CASH AFTER SILVERSTONE CRASH</strong></p>
<strong>North London A-Level student</strong> and <strong>Hertfordshire racing driver</strong> Damani Marcano, recently competed in severe weather conditions in the VW Racing Cup at Silverstone (12th June 2016) – home of the British Grand Prix.  The 17 year old's first race of the day, in torrential rain and a blinding wall of spray, resulted in a serious crash with a car ahead that was crawling along the track having lost power. Invisible to Damani until the last second, the slow moving car suddenly appeared from the spray. Both drivers were fine and walked away from the collision, a testament to the levels of safety in motorsport today, but Marcano’s 260bhp Team-HARD. VW Golf GTI R Cup Car was left in bad shape.

After Race 1 the Team-HARD. crew pulled together in tremendous form, re-building Damani’s car, sourcing parts from team cars and even stripping Team Principal Tony Gilham’s road car for bodywork!  In the space of four hours the team brought Marcano’s car back to life and made them both race-ready, minutes before the call to line-up, the decision was made by race officials to cancel the second race and not risk the treacherous conditions again.

The crash at Silverstone was costly to the young driver and now the race is on to raise enough funding to perform permanent repairs to the car and support the continuation of his season at one of the biggest races of the year – Spa Francorchamps.  Damani is offering new sponsorship opportunities to local businesses in a bid to raise the funding he needs.

Damani, the youngest driver in the series, is tipped to be a future star of the British Touring Car Championships. Racing against experienced adult drivers only since he was 16 and now in only his second season Damani has been moving up the field with his best finish to date at the last round just 3 places from the podium.

With nearly <strong>4,000 followers</strong> on social media and over <strong>1.4million impressions on Twitter in 2016</strong> alone, VIP Hospitality packages and more, Damani Marcano presents a unique opportunity for local businesses to reach a wide new audience. Companies can support Damani with car-parts or cash sponsorship packages; all budgets can be accommodated.

After what happened to me it was obvious that visibility made racing too dangerous and the officials' decision to cancel the second race was the right call. Team HARD did an amazing job getting the car race-worthy in time, I can’t thank them enough. The repairs will make a big dent in my race budget and I don't know if it will cover that and Spa without affecting my ability to finish the season. With the support of local businesses that see the opportunity in being a part of my story, anything is possible. They will be joining the other brands from around the UK who have made my racing possible so far.”</em>

Along with his racing career, the Hertfordshire based 17 year old is studying ALevels in Further Maths, Maths, Physics and Design Technology in the 6th form of a school in Haringey, North London.

<p style="text-align: right;">1<sup>st</sup> June 2016</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TEEN RACING DRIVER STUNS WITH BEST RESULT SO FAR</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>– 17 yr old closing in on a podium in the </em><em>Volkswagen Racing Cup at Oulton Park −</em></p>
Up and coming teen racing driver Damani Marcano competed in his second race of the Milltek Sport Volkswagen Racing Cup at Oulton Park over the bank holiday weekend - 28<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> May. Now in his second season with Team-HARD in their young driver development programme, Marcano’s improvement and confidence was clear to see.

<a href="http://damanimarcano-racing.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/damani-marcano-in-car-close-via-window.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-14201 alignright" src="http://damanimarcano-racing.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/damani-marcano-in-car-close-via-window.jpg" alt="damani-marcano-in-car-close-via-window" width="330" /></a>The race weekend wasn’t all plain sailing however, with testing on Friday presenting challenges which took all day to iron out. It wasn’t until the final session where Marcano found a set up that worked. With little opportunity to practice driving the track Damani entered qualifying feeling unprepared, yet persevered and qualified in the top 10.

Marcano went into Race 1 feeling confident that he could improve upon his previous best finish of 10<sup>th. </sup> This was achieved with an improved setup for the race and adjustments to his own driving. Then, in the race, a plug got jammed under the throttle preventing Marcano from getting full throttle and at points no throttle at all on corner exits. Despite having to drive around the problem and a safety car mid race, preventing any overtakes for several laps, Marcano still delivered an 8th place finish which is his best in the Volkswagen Racing Cup so far.

Race 2 saw Marcano starting where he finished. With a difficult start he lost several places. The race was spent trying to recover, leaving him in 11th.

It all came together in Race 3 where he was able to start in 10<sup>th</sup> position based on qualifying times again. Marcano pushed on to find yet more pace, with lap times down to the 1m53s along with the majority of the leading cars. Advancing from 10th to 6th in this 20 minute race, up against some of the most experienced drivers in the Volkswagen Racing Cup was a huge accomplishment.

I also learned what I need to do to get more out of the car and myself and I’m really excited to take this into my next races at Silverstone. Team-HARD. did an amazing job supporting me this weekend. With all the challenges we faced, to improve first with an 8th place and then to end the weekend with 6th was an amazing result.”

Damani Marcano is the youngest driver in the series, competing against drivers with years more driving and racing experience. The Milltek Sport Volkswagen Racing Cup is widely regarded as one of the most competitive saloon car racing series.

<strong>Team-HARD. principal, Tony Gilham comments: </strong><em>“Yet again Damani has demonstrated professionalism both on and off the track. Damani has been under immense pressure with exams over the previous few months, yet he takes it all in his stride. Much like his handling of the throttle issues in Race 1, Damani stayed calm and still brought it home in 8<sup>th</sup> – his best finish in the Volkswagen Racing Cup up to that point! To end the weekend further forward again with 6<sup>th</sup> puts him within three positions of a podium. Damani is a promising young talent and I’m excited to see what happens at Silverstone.”</em>
